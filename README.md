# Demonstration code for the "Building a complete RL system" lecture

## Introduction
This code demonstrates our implementation of SARSA for the [Taxi-v3](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/toy_text/taxi/) environment and serves as additional information to go alongside the "Building a complete RL system" lecture.
The lecture is delivered as part of the [Reinforcement Learning (2023) course](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/22-23/dpt/cxinfr11010.htm) at the University of Edinburgh.

## Dependencies
To run the python code, you will need [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) which can be installed using

    pip install gym matplotlib numpy

## Jupyter Notebook
**We recommend going through the jupyter notebook file of this demonstration in your own time!** This includes further information and explanations to understand this demonstration and learn more about good practises in RL evaluation.
You can directly view the notebook [here](https://github.com/uoe-agents/Building-a-Complete-RL-System_Demonstration/blob/master/rl_demo.ipynb) or run it yourself with jupyter. To install the required software and run the notebook provided with the code, follow the instructions on the [Jupyter mainpage](https://jupyter.org/).

## Code
All code is written in Python3 and provided as separate scripts and all-together in one Jupyter notebook available [here](https://github.com/uoe-agents/Building-a-Complete-RL-System_Demonstration/blob/master/rl_demo.ipynb) with further explanations.
